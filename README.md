  The Scrabble Game is the fifth assignment for the GUI-I class. In this assignment, I applied the knowledge of jQuery UI including HTML and CSS.  My task is to implement a part of the Scrabble game using drag-and-drop functionality. The game will display one line of the Scrabble board, along with a tile rack containing seven letter tiles, to the user. The user will then be able to drag and drop tiles onto the board to create words. My responsibility also includes calculating and reporting the score, taking into account the values assigned to each letter and the bonus squares. 

What can a user expect in this game:

1. Initial Letter Distribution - At the beginning of the game, seven random letters are selected from a data structure and displayed on the user's tile rack.
2. Reset Functionality: The game provides a reset button that allows the user to restart the game. 
3. Drag-and-Drop Interaction: The user can employ drag-and-drop actions to manipulate the letter tiles. 
4. Bonus Square Calculation: The Scrabble board incorporates special squares such as "double word score" and "double letter score," which impact the value of placed tiles.
5. Calculation: The game accurately calculates the scoring bonuses associated with these squares based on the assigned tile values, enhancing strategic gameplay. The game also keeps track of the score of multiple words. 
6. Score Display: Above the Scrabble board, the game provides a score tracker that informs the user about the word they are currently forming, the current score, and the number of remaining tiles in their possession as well as the scores that they have accumulated so far. 
7. Word Selection Display: There are seven dots positioned above the Scrabble board. These dots serve as visual indicators, representing the selected and placed words on the board.

# These are some of the features that the user can enjoy.
